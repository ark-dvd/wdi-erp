## 1. Purpose (LOCKED)

This document constitutes the sole authoritative registry of all constitutional,
foundational, and binding documents governing the WDI ERP system.

No document shall be considered canonical, binding, or enforceable unless it is
explicitly listed and maintained in this registry.

This registry is the entry point, index, and authority map of the system’s
constitutional framework.

---

## 2. Scope & Authority (LOCKED)

This registry governs:
- The existence of constitutional documents
- Their authoritative status
- Their versioning and lifecycle
- Their amendment, supersession, or retirement

If a conflict exists between code and a registered document, the document prevails.
If a conflict exists between two documents, the registry prevails.
